                <h2 id="sectionhead" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> My Book Journey </h2>
                    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
                        I used to be a type of person who wonders that how people even read the novels. Like come on, there's no background music no visuals, how 
                        can one imagine everything!! If you are thinking the same or used to think like that, then continue reading to see what changed now.<br>
                        I used to go to library all the time in kkr gowtham school, frankly speaking i only used to go to check the movie page in newspaper!!
                        But i used to see my friends some people reading books. I tried reading percy jackson book by my friend suggestion but i couldn't imagine 
                        the things and so i stopped it. cut to Btech.<br>
                        Here i got some friends who reads books all the time, yeah bookworms. So when you have friends like that you have no other option but to 
                        give it a try so that you can talk about it. so i picked Revolution 2020 book by chetan bhagath. And wow.. i got hooked and finished the book 
                        in a week or so. There goes my first book that too a romance genre. so yeah, may be you can try a teenage romance genre book as a start.
                        <br>After that i kept trying different genre to get to experience all feeling through books and to understand what kind of genre i would like.
                        So my second book is from thriller genre - Agatha christe's - And Then there were none. That's when i fell in love wit thriller genre!!
                        From then i totally loved thriller books and read more and more.That's two books in 2019.  so if you are trying to get into reading, my suggestion would be first try one small  book and then try anoter of different genre. I'm sure you will click with one genre and from there you got it.
                        <br> If you are struggling with even the 100 pages book then don't worry i got you! There are these webcomics called webtoons which are basically
                        comics that you read by scrolling down and believe when i say it they have some great stories like money heist, no kidding. Just give a try.
                        By that you can get used to reading and later on move to books. I am pretty begineer too. In here i would also like to add <i> you are a blend of 
                            five of your close friends. Be wise with surroundings
                        </i> 
                        GOOD LUCK and Let's read books:)

But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him The Fittest (Real) Man in America. <br>After reading about how he stayed strong through all the tough times, it motivated me to
                face challenges in my life with strong mentality. I strarted a proper workout routine after reading this book, trying my best to do it daily. This Book
                will make you awe with david's mentality and will literally change you life. MUST READ BOOK.</p>

While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?</p>

                <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;letter-spacing: 1px;">Dr. King was such an eloquent writer.  I couldn't put this book down the first time I read it and now reach for it at times of needing strength and courage.  An incredibly brave man who lived in constant fear for his family and himself yet still marched forward for the greater good of the people who looked to him for leadership.  Whether having an interest in the civil rights movement or not this is a wonderful read and spending time in this great man's company, through the words he has left us, can only be of benefit to everyone.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</p>

But itâ€™s senior year, and suddenly Sal is throwing punches, questioning everything, and realizing he no longer knows himself. If Salâ€™s not who he thought he was, who is he? <br>Throughout this book, the redemptive power of love flows, seeping into the lives of others whose only choice is then to pass it along. In this book, there are characters who have experienced love their whole lives, others who should have been loved, but who were mistreated by those who should have loved them, and others wounded and damaged by abuse. The father of the central character, a gay man, took in everyone who was hungry for love and shared his own, demonstrating that â€œlove is only love when you give it away, and that in giving love both the lover and the beloved are enriched. you will thoroughly enjoy the book.</p>
