                    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
                        I am an active movie watching person, i don't watch to time pass. I keenly watch every scene and make insights and develop my mindset. I watch movies from many different languages like.. korean,thai,japanese,french, and all local languages.<br>And man... series, i totally enjoy watching series. I watch all kinds of series like sitcoms, English series, korean series, Anime. I enjoy everything it's nice to see differnt cultures from just sitting in your room, isn't it cool!? Of all these things, most interesting thing is, Some series change the way you think and behave. For example, Thomas 
                        shelby from Peaky Blinders, his attitude is out of the world. Type of a person who can change the atmosphere of a room as soon as he walk on. And professor from money heist, tells you how you should think before making a decision. Walter white from Breaking bad, he shows the consequences of 
                        greed and shows how priorities change as we meet people. Every series and every movie tells you something and i like to note them down. so let's share them.

                I am a highly organized person and likes to keep track of everything in notion. Particularly this might seem unnecessary, but believe this builds a sense 
                of discipline and that's what most important for anyone. so to build discipline i like to use notion atleast this way, not just this there are many other 
                ways i use notion. will show you in interests page. As you can see there are 61+ series and it's hard to pick favourites, i will try my best to give you 5 tops of mine. welcome to the mad series and movies journey.

It's got an amazing cast Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy, Adrian Brody to name a few and Steven Knight to pen down some marvellous quotes. </p>

Starting from the really creative look of the show and the way they have incorporated a fairytale to explain the character's feelings and actions in each of the episodes is really new and unique. Right from the first episode, I was pulled in and I really didn't want it to end.HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</p>
